Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was to help seperate a grocery store with items bought. A document would be created and each time someone bought a item it would add it to a list in the document. The program would help give a count of each item and how many times it was bought from that list.

What did you do particularly well?
For me adding the error message if the code couldnt reach the file. This would help the user and myself if the document was unreachable or if there was something wrong with the documentation.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could add an option for the user to insert their own document instead of having the one that is given. It gives a the user more control of just inserting what they need and not needing to worry about the specific name given for the file.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
For me the way the program displays was challenging, its tough to right something that you won't know what its supposed to look like. But I think just like writing you just need to start and just run the program over and over again so that you can make the adjustments as you go.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think just like up above, using old display outputs help and just try to adjust them to work with the program.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I usually try to keep everything together, I use blank spaces to seperate the classes so that its not cluttered and unorganized.
